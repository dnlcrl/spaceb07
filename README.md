# spaceb07
Code for my first Twitter bot: http://twitter.com/spaceb07, running on Heroku.

Every 24 hours spaceb07 downloads a random GIF tagged "space" from Giphy.com and tweets it.

# Create Your Own Bot:

1. Create your twitter account and setup an app for that account on the twitter's developers page, so you can have all the needed security tokens.
2. Run `init.sh` and follow the instructions to create an Heroku app for your bot.
3. Edit the `bot.py` file to customize your bot and cast some spells.
4. Push the edits on heroku with `git push heroku master`.
5. Enjoy.
